# Pokedex-app

This app was created while taking wab development courses with CareerFoundry. 

The app displays a list of Pokemons, and was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and Bootstrap. 
The information of Pokemons is fethed from an external API ('https://pokeapi.co'), and is displayed in a modal window.
Fetched information includes name, height, weight and an image.
